Here's a new idea for managing road segments:

A lane is a part of one road node, allowing one vehicle in parallel
A lane strip is a connection between two lanes of two same (U-turn) or different road nodes
A road strip is an ordered collection of lane strips, from the left to the right

Each lane strip belongs to one road strip
Road strips can't be duplicated in the same direction like this:
-OK: Strips A-B and A-C
-OK: Strips A-B and B-A
-OK: Strips A-A and A-B
-Not allowed: Strips A-B and A-B
-Not allowed: Strips A-A and A-A

Drawbacks of this technique:
-Lanes are only one way

Variant: Lane strips can't be duplicated disregarding their direction
This allows two-way lanes, but slightly complicates vehicle AI
